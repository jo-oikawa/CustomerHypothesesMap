# Motivations

Legend: Pastel (all colors AA contrast with black text at normal sizes)

Each motivation includes a short description of the underlying intent / value sought.

- M1 Stay in flow (#F9C5C4) – Minimize interruptions, context switching, and editor friction so momentum and cognitive immersion are preserved.
- M2 Maintain control & intent (#F9D2B8) – Ensure changes reflect deliberate author intent; avoid opaque automation or hard‑to‑trace side effects.
- M3 Ship reliable code faster (#F9E3AD) – Compress the cycle from idea to correct, test‑validated code reaching production with fewer rework loops.
- M4 Improve code quality & consistency (#ECF3AE) – Raise and standardize structural, stylistic, and architectural quality across the codebase.
- M5 Understand unfamiliar code quickly (#D2F2BB) – Form a trustworthy mental model of new or legacy areas rapidly (purpose, contracts, side effects).
- M6 Reduce cognitive load (#BFF1D7) – Offload mechanical memory (boilerplate, syntax, scattered context) to free working memory for problem solving.
- M7 Preserve trust & accuracy (#BDEDF0) – Gain confidence that surfaced information, suggestions, and transformations are correct and reversible.
- M8 Customize workflow deeply (#C7E1F9) – Adapt tools, shortcuts, automations, and layouts to personal/team workflow and tech stack nuances.
- M9 Learn continuously (#D4D4FA) – Acquire just‑in‑time insights (APIs, patterns, domain knowledge) without derailing active work.
- M10 Collaborate seamlessly (#E1CDF7) – Share context, rationale, and changes with teammates smoothly, reducing alignment overhead.
- M11 Ensure security & compliance (#F2C9EF) – Surface and prevent vulnerable or non‑compliant patterns early in the authoring loop.
- M12 Maintain performance (#F9C3E0) – Keep editor, builds, tests, and navigation fast even as codebases scale.
- M13 Communicate product intent clearly (#F9C9D1) – Bridge design/product rationale to implementation so purpose is preserved in build decisions.
- M14 Validate feasibility early (#F9D8C5) – Rapidly test technical constraints to de‑risk scope and refine requirements before deep investment.
- M15 Reduce handoff loss (#F9E9B8) – Minimize information decay (decisions, edge cases, rationale) during transitions between roles or phases.
- M16 Compound leverage from AI (#E6F5B5) – Chain multiple AI assists into higher‑order workflows for multiplicative efficiency.
- M17 Optimize ROI of AI usage (#CFF3C9) – Measure and tune AI involvement to maximize quality/speed gains vs. effort and risk.
- M18 Steward model & context quality (#C3F1E7) – Curate prompts, examples, and project context to sustain accurate, relevant AI outputs.
- M19 Govern safe automation (#C9E7F9) – Apply boundaries, auditing, and rollback around automated or large‑scale AI changes.
